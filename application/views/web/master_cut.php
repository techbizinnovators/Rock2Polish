                                These are diamonds grown in a controlled laboratory, wherein a team of gemologists and scientists strive to replicate natural processes of diamond making which otherwise takes millions of years to form under the ground. HPHT stands for high pressure, high temperature and is one of the primary methods used to grow diamonds in a lab. This diamond growth process subjects carbon to extreme temperatures and pressures and is meant to replicate the extreme heat and pressure conditions deep within the earth where natural diamonds form.

                        <p>
                                Some people might refer to lab-grown diamonds as imitations or simulants, but this is incorrect. Actual imitations like cubic zirconia or synthetic moissanite — which only look like diamond — have very different chemical and physical properties that allow trained gemologists to identify them easily. However, lab-grown diamonds are more challenging to detect.

                                How can I tell if a diamond is a lab-grown or natural?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                                One cannot differentiate between a Natural Diamond and an HPHT diamond. They look exactly the same with exact amount of shine. Laboratory-grown diamonds are essentially chemically and optically the same as their natural counterparts, traditional gemological observations and old-style “diamond detectors” are not able to tell them apart. Identification at a professional gemological laboratory or using sophisticated devices developed by GIA and other organisations are the only reliable methods to separate them from natural diamonds.

                            <p> <u>How are these Lab-cultivated diamonds priced?</u></p>
                            HPHT diamonds are more affordable and inexpensive as compared to natural diamonds costing approximately 25% the price of natural diamonds.
